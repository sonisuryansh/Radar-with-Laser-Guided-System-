🎯 Radar with Laser-Guided System :- 

Welcome to the Radar with Laser-Guided System project! This innovative system combines radar technology with a laser-guided mechanism to create a powerful tool for real-time object detection and response. Whether you're interested in security applications, automated guidance, or simply exploring the fascinating world of sensors and robotics, this project offers a hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology.

🚀 Features :- 

Precision Ultrasonic Sensing: The system accurately detects objects at three distinct distances:

🌐 200 cm - Blue LED illuminates.
⚠️ 100 cm - Yellow LED activates.
🚨 50 cm - Red LED flashes, and a buzzer sounds to alert.
Laser-Guided Response: When an object is within 50 cm for more than 3 seconds, the system triggers a laser for 5 seconds, providing a precise and responsive action.

Real-Time Monitoring: Data is streamed directly to a connected PC via serial communication, with an emergency message appearing when a close-range object is detected.

Visual Interface: The included Processing sketch provides a real-time visualization of radar data, allowing you to see the system in action.
